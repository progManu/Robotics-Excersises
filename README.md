# Robotics Exercises in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for robotics exercises assigned as homework for [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/it)'s robotics course. The exercises cover various concepts in robotics, including kinematics, and simulation.

## Table of Contents

1. **Homogenous matrices:** Indentify the homogeneous matrix that maps from the base to the end-effector
2. **Vector Parameters:** Define with vector parameters or DH the refrence frames of the robot
3. **Orientations:** Here the objective is to move the end-effector of a painting robot tangent to a plane with a particular painting (curve on it). The end effector must keep the same orientation w.r.t the canvas and follow the trajectory.
4. **Kinematics:** This is a 4 dof robot, with 4 rotoidal joints (this are orthogonal or parallel so we can define the robot with DH or ...). The objective is to calculatate the position of the joint variables using the inverse kinematics.
5. **Kinematics:** This is a 7 dof robot, with a spherical wrist. The objective is to calculatate the position of the joint variables using the inverse kinematics.
6. **Manipulability:** Given a cable robot with 2 dof, evaluate the manipulability.

## Setup

To run the MATLAB code in this repository, you will need MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from the official [MathWorks website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
