# Robotics Exercises in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB code for robotics exercises assigned as homework for [University of Trieste](https://portale.units.it/it)'s robotics course. The exercises cover various concepts in robotics, including kinematics, and simulation.

## Table of Contents

1. **Homogenous matrices:** Indentify the homogeneous matrix that maps from the base to the end-effector
2. **Vector Parameters:** Define with vector parameters or DH the refrence frames of the robot
3. **Orientations:** Here the objective is to move the end-effector of a painting robot tangent to a plane with a particular painting (curve on it). The end effector must keep the same orientation w.r.t the canvas and follow the trajectory.
